</h3>

The challenge goal is to create a Rest API with Node JS with Typescript using the express framework and the model, repositories and services concepts. It's also necessary use TypeORM with PostgreSQL to persist data and use Multer to send files.


- GET /transactions: to list all transactions and sum of all transactions spliting by income, outcome and the total;
- POST /transactions: to register a new transaction;
- DELETE /transactions/:id: to delete a transaction based on its id;
- POST /transactions/import: to upload a csv file with the necessary data to create multiple transactions. Each line of the file is a new transaction.
